# Quant-Finance_Portfolio
The Journey of a normal person to a specialist in quant

A collection of systematic trading strategy projects and portfolio simulations using Python and some extra stuff that I am just curious about.

## 1: Equity & Crypto Data Analysis

- Source: Yahoo Finance, CoinGecko
- Assets: SPY (S&P 500 ETF), BTC, ETH
- Outputs: Returns, cumulative returns, volatility, drawdowns, visualizations

## 2: Trading strategy:
- Developed and tested my first systematic trading strategy: a Moving Average Strategy on SPY.
- Generated trading signals (buy/sell)
- Evaluated performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdown)

## 3: Options model validation
Built:
- black_scholes_price function 
- black_scholes_greeks function
- stress_test_vol_surface()function
- benchmark_market_quote and generate_validation_report as functions
- tested through fictitious input parameters
